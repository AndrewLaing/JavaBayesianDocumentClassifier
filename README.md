# JavaBayesianDocumentClassifier
A simple example usage of the Bayesian Classifier contained in my JavaBayesianClassifier repo.<br /><br />
I trained a version of this to classify Java, Python, C, C++, VB.Net files and it works fairly well. It worked much better of Fiction of course and was easily able to tell the difference between Jane Austen and Viginia Wolfe after being trained on several text files from  Project Gutenberg.
